# üìö Glossary

This glossary explains technical terms and concepts used throughout the DaiDev project documentation.

## üîß Development Terms

### **Monorepo**
A software development strategy where multiple related projects are stored in the same repository. In DaiDev, all 6 sub-applications are managed in a single repository using Turborepo.

### **Sub-applications (Sub-apps)**
Individual applications within the monorepo:
- **Web App** - Public portfolio website
- **Admin Dashboard** - Content management interface
- **Backend API** - Server-side API service
- **Documentation** - Technical documentation site
- **Theme Detail** - Micro frontend for themes
- **Swagger Proxy** - API documentation interface

### **Micro Frontend**
An architectural pattern where a frontend application is decomposed into smaller, semi-independent applications. In DaiDev, the Theme Detail app is a micro frontend that can be embedded into the main Web App.

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. DaiDev's Backend API provides REST endpoints for frontend applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Terms

A class that determines whether a request will be handled by the route handler. Used in DaiDev for authentication and authorization.

### **Interceptor**
A class that can transform the result returned from a function. Used in DaiDev for logging, error handling, and response transformation.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Terms

### **Collection**
A group of documents in MongoDB (similar to a table in SQL). DaiDev has collections for Users, Themes, Blogs, etc.

### **Document**
A record in a MongoDB collection (similar to a row in SQL). Each document contains data in JSON format.

### **Schema**
A blueprint that defines the structure of documents in a collection. Used in DaiDev to validate data and define relationships.

### **Index**
A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. Used in DaiDev to optimize database queries.

### **Aggregation**
A framework for data processing in MongoDB. Used in DaiDev for complex queries and data analysis.

## üîê Security Terms

### **Authentication**
The process of verifying who a user is. In DaiDev, users authenticate using email/password and receive a JWT token.

### **Authorization**
The process of determining what a user can access. In DaiDev, users have roles (admin/viewer) that determine their permissions.

### **bcrypt**
A password hashing function used to securely hash user passwords in DaiDev.

### **Rate Limiting**
A technique to limit the number of requests a user can make to an API. Used in DaiDev to prevent abuse.

### **Input Validation**
The process of ensuring that user input meets expected criteria. Used in DaiDev to prevent malicious data.

## üåê External Services

### **Cloudinary**
A cloud-based service for managing images and videos. Used in DaiDev for image upload and optimization.

### **Resend**
An email delivery service. Used in DaiDev for sending contact form emails.

### **Google reCAPTCHA**
A service that protects websites from spam and abuse. Used in DaiDev's contact form.

### **MongoDB Atlas**
A cloud database service for MongoDB. Used to host DaiDev's database.

## üöÄ Deployment Terms

### **Vercel**
A cloud platform for deploying frontend applications. Used to host DaiDev's frontend apps.

### **Railway**
A cloud platform for deploying backend applications. Used to host DaiDev's backend API.

### **Environment Variables**
Configuration values that are set outside of the application code. Used in DaiDev for database connections, API keys, etc.

### **Build Process**
The process of converting source code into a production-ready application. In DaiDev, each sub-app has its own build process.

### **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
A method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development.

## üìä Performance Terms

### **Caching**
A technique to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval. Used in DaiDev to improve performance.
