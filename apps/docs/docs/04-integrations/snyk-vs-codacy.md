# Security & Code Quality: Snyk vs Codacy

## 🛡️ Snyk
**Primary Goal**: Security-first platform

### Key Features:
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**: Scan dependencies (npm, Maven, pip, Go, …) for CVEs.
- **Container Security**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Scan Terraform, Kubernetes YAML, etc. for misconfigurations.
- **Code Security (Snyk Code)**: Detect vulnerabilities in source code.

### Pros:
- Strong focus on **security**.
- Continuously updated CVE database (including proprietary sources).
- **Fix suggestions** (auto-suggest secure dependency versions).
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.).

### Cons:
- Limited on **code quality** checks (naming, convention, etc.).
- Free plan has scan/project limits.

## 📊 Codacy
**Primary Goal**: Code quality & maintainability

### Key Features:
- **Static Analysis**: Check code style, best practices, and security issues (rule-based).
- **Coverage Report**: Integrate with tests to monitor code coverage.
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Measure “technical debt” in the codebase.
- **Security linting**: Some static analysis for issues (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets).

### Pros:
- Strong in **code quality** and **coding standards**.
- Supports 40+ languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Go, C#, …).
- Clear dashboards and metrics.
- Good for enforcing **coding guidelines**.

### Cons:
- Security rules weaker and slower to update than Snyk.
- Limited features for IaC and container security.

## 🔑 Key Differences

| Criteria              | **Snyk** (Security-first)           | **Codacy** (Quality-first)             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Main Goal**          | Detect & fix security vulnerabilities | Improve code quality & maintainability |
| **Focus**              | Dependencies, IaC, containers, security | Coding standards, coverage, debt       |
| **Security Database**  | Proprietary CVE + continuous update | Rule-based static analysis             |
| **Fix suggestion**     | Yes (dependency updates)            | No                                     |
| **Coverage/Test**      | No                                  | Yes                                    |
| **Best Use Case**      | Prevent vulnerabilities in libraries & configs | Keep codebase clean & maintainable   |

### Meaning
- **Codacy** → Ensures clean code, proper conventions, and test coverage.
- **Snyk** → Prevents vulnerabilities from dependencies, containers, IaC, and source code.
- **CI/CD Gate** → If **critical issues** found → pipeline fails → developers must fix before merge.

## 📌 Impact Matrix (Snyk vs Codacy)

| Role          | Snyk (Security)                                | Codacy (Code Quality)                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Developers**| Get early alerts on vulnerable dependencies & code | Get coding style, lint, and coverage feedback |
| **QA Team**   | Secure build artifacts & configs                | Ensure tests + maintainable codebase          |
| **Security**  | Continuous monitoring of CVEs & container risks | Limited (rule-based security linting)         |
| **Ops/DevOps**| IaC + Container scanning for secure deployments | Codebase maintainability metrics              |
| **Management**| Reduced risk exposure, compliance               | Lower technical debt, higher productivity     |
